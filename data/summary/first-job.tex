\begin{cvparagraph}
Currently pursuing a Master's degree in Aerospace Engineering, I have expertise in flight control systems, aerodynamics, and simulations. Additionally, I am proficient in Python and C++ for software development and machine learning, which have been instrumental in developing my thesis project - a machine learning-based autopilot that learns to control an aircraft under adverse conditions, such as structural damage. As I near the completion of my studies, I am eager to leverage my acquired skills and knowledge in a professional setting.
